# MNIST_nn
The code classifies numbers from the MNIST database with a resolution of 28x28, 60000 training examples and 10000 test examples.
The code trains a neural network using either 1 of 2 methods. Using stadard gradient descent(upto 89% accuracy) or using the scipy.optimize function(upto 85% accuracy).
The neural network itself is a 785 by 51 by 10 network with 784 a bias unit in layers 1 and 2.
